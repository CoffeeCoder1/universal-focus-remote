A remote focus controller for ETC Eos consoles (and maybe more to come!).
This is the successor to my [ETC Eos Remote](https://github.com/CoffeeCoder1/etc-eos-remote) app.

This app is designed to allow you to remotely control lighting consoles from a tablet or computer, allowing for easy focusing of lights.
